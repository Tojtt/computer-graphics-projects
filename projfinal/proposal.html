	<h2>Project Description:</h2>
	  <p>
		Particle Simulation. We are trying to solve the problem of representing certain particle movement. In this case, we want to simulate the movement of fire in a 2D space. 
		<br>
This problem is important because in animation, there are many times we want to model specific environments (such as snow falling, rain, etc.). Fire movement can be applied to different scenes, and used in animations. 
		<br>
We are going to solve this problem by creating a simulation of fire. We will implement the fire movement using Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and then apply a shader on top to make the simulation look like fire (instead of smoke).
	  </p>
  	<h2>Goals and Deliverables:</h2>
	  <p>
		We would measure our success by the quality and realism of the simulation. We will also compare different version of our simulator (playing around with blurring values, shaders, and other settings).  We will do a video demonstration of the simulation for the fire with proper shaders. Potentially, we could create an interactive system that spawns fire upon interactions with users. 
	  </p>
	  <p><b>What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?</b></p>
	  <p><ul>
		<li>How can we manipulate smoke in order to give off the effect of fire instead? </li>
		<li>How does different shader techniques/settings affect the way fire is portrayed/looks? </li>
		<li>Can we apply different shaders to create different kinds of particles that are outside of fire and smoke? </li>
	  </ul></p>
	  <p><b>You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver.</b></p>
	  <p>In (1), 
		Our baseline expectation is a working simulation of the fire with proper shaders and realistic movements (properly implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier-Stokes_equations" target="_blank">Navier-Stokes equations</a>). In (2), 
		If things go well, we hope to achieve this simulation in 3-D, which would look really cool.
