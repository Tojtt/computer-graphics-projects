        <h3 align="middle">Overview</h3>

        <p>In this project, we implemented a real-time simulation of cloth using a mass and spring based system. We built the data structures to discretely represent the cloth, define and apply physical constraints on them, and apply numerical integration to simulate the way cloth moves over time. Finally, we implemented collisions with other objects as well as self-collisions to prevent cloth clipping.

        <p>
            The render that only involves one bounce represents direct illumination, meaning that the left specular sphere only reflects the area light source, while the rays incident on the sphere from other points in the scene create ray paths with more than one bounce. The right transmissive sphere also reflects the area light source, but it is dimmer and noisier due to the probabilistic approach used to approximate partial reflection and refraction governed by the Fresnel reflection.
            <br><br>
            In the two-bounce render, the diffusive elements of the scene are reflected in the specular sphere on the left. Interestingly, the reflection of the left sphere shows that the right transmissive sphere appears black while the right sphere itself appears cloudy yet reflective, because any ray paths going from the diffusive surroundings, reflecting off of the right sphere, and subsequently reflecting off the left sphere involve three bounces.
            <br><br>
            The three-bounce render provides a more accurate representation of the right transmissive sphere in the reflection of the left sphere. It also features a bright spot below the transmissive sphere, where the refracted rays from the area light source have converged and reached the ground. Lastly, the right sphere shows a warped portion of the blue wall that is inverted horizontally and vertically, as is typical of refractive glass spheres.
            <br><br>
            In the four-bounce (and more) render, the most notable new element is the bright spot on the blue wall, which is the image of the area light source reflected in the left sphere.
