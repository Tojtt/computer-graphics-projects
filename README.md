# Computer Graphics Projects

This repo showcases projects that I worked on in CS184: Computer Graphics at UC Berkeley. 

## Project Webpages

There are 5 folders, one for each project. Each contains an index.html file. When the links from the mainpage are clicked, these files will be loaded, so edit these to add your project webpages. 

Below are direct links to the projects for convenience:

Project 1 page
